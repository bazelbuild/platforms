"""
The platform_data rule can be used to change the target platform of a target,
and then depend on that elsewhere in the build tree. For example:
load("@platforms//experimental/platform_data:defs.bzl", "platform_data")

cc_binary(name = "foo")

platform_data(
    name = "foo_embedded",
    target = ":foo",
    platform = "//my/new:platform",
)

py_binary(
    name = "flasher",
    srcs = ...,
    data = [
        ":foo_embedded",
    ],
)

Regardless of what platform the top-level :flasher binary is built for,
the :foo_embedded target will be built for //my/new:platform.

Note that if you depend on :foo_embedded it's not exactly the same as depending on :foo, since it won't forward all the same providers. In the future, we can extend this to add some common providers as needed."""
